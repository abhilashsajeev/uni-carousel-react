# uni-carousel-react

## Please note that this version works with react 0.13.* We have not updating this to react 0.14 for a while because we use react0.13 in out project.

## This is an enhanced port of nuka-carousel 

## Features implemented in addition to nuka-carousel see [Demo](http://abhilashsajeev.github.io/uni-carousel-react)
  * Slide scrolls according to swipe speed.
  * End firction improved.
  * No empty space at the edges.
  * More suitable for carousel containing multiple items


### Our primery aim to make this work in protrait mode with 3 items to show.
There is a difference from nuka-carousel, user does not need to pass **slideToScroll** as property any more, By default it is 1 and according to your swipe speed the **slideToScroll** adjusts automatically

### For trial purpose you may install with

```
npm install uni-carousel-react --save
```

### Documentation is much same as that of **nuka-carousel**. Remember this is just an extension of **nuka-carousel** with some additional features.
But you donot need to provide **slideToScroll** property any more. it defaults to 1 and changes accoding to swipe speed.
