# uni-carousel-react

### This is a custom port of nuka-carousel

## Created for a custom usage we recomend not to use it for production.  
I strongly reccomend not to use this in production untill we stabilises it. For production use nuka-carousel.

### Our primery aim to make this work in protrait mode with 3 items to show.
There is a difference from nuka-carousel, user does not need to pass **slideToScroll** as property any more, By default it is 1 and according to your swipe speed the **slideToScroll** adjusts automatically

### For trial purpose you may install with

```
npm install uni-carousel-react --save
```

### Documentation is much same as that of **nuka-carousel**. Remember this is just an extension of **nuka-carousel** with some additional features.
But you donot need to provide **slideToScroll** property any more. it defaults to 1 and changes accoding to swipe speed.
