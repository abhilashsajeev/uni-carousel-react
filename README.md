# uni-carousel-react
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/uni-carousel-react.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/uni-carousel-react)
## Please note that this version works with react 0.14.* (from version 0.3.x onwards) . For users who are still in react 0.13.3 use version 0.1.16.

## This is an enhanced port of nuka-carousel 

## Features implemented in addition to nuka-carousel see [Demo](http://abhilashsajeev.github.io/uni-carousel-react)
  * Slide scrolls according to swipe speed (I've not seen this feature in any other carousel).
  * End firction improved.
  * No empty space at the edges.
  * More suitable for carousel containing multiple items



### Our primery aim to make this work in protrait mode with 3 items to show.
There is a difference from nuka-carousel, user does not need to pass **slideToScroll** as property any more, By default it is 1 and according to your swipe speed the **slideToScroll** adjusts automatically

### Install with

```
npm install uni-carousel-react --save
```

### Documentation is much same as that of **nuka-carousel**. Remember this is just an extension of **nuka-carousel** with some additional features.
But you donot need to provide **slideToScroll** property any more. it defaults to 1 and changes accoding to swipe speed.
